Welcome to my portfolio website,

This portfolio consists of HTML, SCSS, JQuery, PHP / Laravel.
Using PHP / Laravel I have created a backend interface which can be used to add work / projects directly onto my portfolio website, edit them or delete them.


Open a terminal and add the following code to start the server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Add /werken or /werken/create behind the link.
